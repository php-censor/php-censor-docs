Plugin Composer
===============

Allows you to run Composer within your build, to install dependencies prior to testing. Best run as a "setup" stage 
plugin.

Configuration
-------------

### Options

* **action** [optional, string, update|install|...] - Action you wish Composer to run (default: 'install').
Any composer command optionally with arguments is a valid action, like 'outdated --ansi'.
* **prefer_dist** [optional, bool, true|false] - whether Composer should run with the `--prefer-dist` flag 
(default: false).
* **prefer_source** [optional, bool, true|false] - whether Composer should run with the `--prefer-source` flag 
(default: false).
* **no_dev** [optional, bool, true|false] - whether Composer should run with the `--no-dev` flag (default: false).
* **ignore_platform_reqs** [optional, bool, true|false] - whether Composer should run with the `--ignore-platform-reqs` 
flag (default: false).

### Examples

```yml
setup:
    composer_step:
        plugin: composer
        directory: "my/composer/dir"
        action: "update"
        prefer_dist: true
```

Warning
-------

If you are using a Composer private repository like Satis, with HTTP authentication, you must check your username and 
password inside the `auth.json` file. PHP Censor uses the `--no-interaction` flag, so it will not warn if you 
must provide that info.

For more info, please check the Composer documentation.
